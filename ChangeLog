2007-08-27  Aaron Bockover  <abockover@novell.com>

	* autogen.sh: A fresh, hip, autogen

	* src/ServiceLocator.cs:
	* src/Server.cs: Removed old Mono.Zeroconf and Avahi support, replaced
	with new Mono.Zeroconf support (which is a frontend to either 
	mDNSResponder or Avahi support, abstracted from applications or other
	libraries)

	* src/Client.cs: 
	* src/Database.cs: Fix some compiler warnings
	
	* configure.ac: Require Mono.Zeroconf instead of either Avahi or 
	mDNSResponder; check for TagLib#; bump version to 0.4.0

	* sample/SampleServer.cs: Use TagLib instead of Entagged to build the
	sample server

	* sample/Makefile.am: Fixed up to link against TagLib

2007-01-29  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Database.cs: fix a regression caused by s/Song/Track/ a while
	back.  Track numbers were not getting fetched on the client side.

2006-10-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Server.cs: add a MachineId property
	* src/ServiceLocator.cs: do the same for Service

	Publish and parse "Machine ID" fields on the server and client
	
2006-10-18  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Client.cs: don't fetch the content codes until Login(), as
	apparently iTunes protects that url with a password (if enabled)

2006-10-02  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/content-codes: updated, includes new codes found in iTunes 7.0

2006-09-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/ContentFetcher.cs: set ServicePoint connection limit to 3.
	We effectively waste one by having the '/update' request, so it's
	easy to run out.

2006-09-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/User.cs: added, represents a user connected to the server
	* src/Server.cs: add user login/logout events as well as a Users
	property for obtaining the list of logged-in users.

2006-09-24  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Client.cs: kill all connections to the server before logging out.

2006-09-23  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/ContentFetcher.cs: correctly close the in-progress requests

2006-09-18  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Server.cs: only password protect the /login path
	iTunes only passes the HTTP password there, and assumes the
	session id is good enough after that.

2006-08-06  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Server.cs: when opening tracks for streaming, use FileAccess.Read
	* src/ContentCodeBag.cs: don't specify the 'content-code' embedded
	resource specifically since when building on Windows it gets assigned
	a totally outrageous name.

2006-07-13  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/ContentCodeBag.cs: add some missing content codes for use
	with iPhoto

2006-07-13  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Database.cs: make the events conform to the standard
	framework design guidelines (added TrackArgs and PlaylistArgs)

2006-07-07  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>
	
	* configure.ac: require the latest Avahi, and bump to 0.3.4
	* src/Server.cs: don't crash if Stop is called more than once

2006-05-24  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Server.cs: add a SongRequested event to Server, so apps
	can do logging or whatever when a song is requested.

2006-05-07  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/ServiceLocator.cs: make sure we properly dispose of the
	Avahi.Client when shutting down.
	* src/Server.cs: ditto

2006-05-07  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* daap-sharp.pc.in: include the .config file

2006-04-07  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* configure.ac: bump to 0.3.3

2006-04-07  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Mono.Zeroconf: synced

2006-04-04  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* src/daap-sharp.dll.config.in: Map to libnss_mdns-0.2.so

	* src/Mono.Zeroconf: synced sources

2006-04-04  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@aaronbock.net>

	* src/Server.cs (UnregisterService): handle exception when trying to
	shutdown the service locator

2006-03-12  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Database.cs: fix DownloadSong()
	* sample/Mirror.cs: call ServiceLocator.Start (oops)

2006-03-12  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Server.cs: support range requests for seeking, and limit the
	number of database revisions kept for creating deltas.
	* src/Client.cs: support seeking (range requests)

2006-03-11  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Mono.Zeroconf/*: updated

2006-03-10  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* configure.ac: bump to 0.3.2
	* src/ContentParser.cs: add workaround for buggy servers.
	If a content code can't be found, fallback to our internal one.

2006-03-07  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Mono.Zeroconf/*: Updated (again)

2006-03-07  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* src/Mono.Zeroconf/*: Updated Mono.Zeroconf sources (run an A query
	in DNSServiceQueryRecord to resolve addresses instead of using 
	gethostbyname)

2006-03-05  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* src/Mono.Zeroconf/*: Updated Mono.Zeroconf sources

2006-02-22  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Database.cs (DownloadSong): don't assume that the length
	argument is valid.

2006-02-21  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* configure.ac: bump to 0.3.1
	* src/Server.cs: fix a small Uri handling problem which was
	causing a bug on windows.
	* src/en/*: updated

2006-02-21  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/daap-sharp.dll.config.in: update the dllmap
	* src/Utility.cs: add ToDateTime and FromDateTime
	* src/*.cs: remove dependence on Mono.Unix

	Make the necessary changes to run on windows

2006-01-20  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* src/Mono.ZeroConf/Service.cs (set_HostTarget): Updated Mono.Zeroconf
	sources	(fix VPN-related DNS resolve bug)

2006-01-20  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* sample/SampleServer.cs: Parse the command line a little better; 
	adds --port, --server-name, --database-name, and --help options

2006-01-19  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* src/daap-sharp.dll.config.in: Map to libdns_sd.so

	* src/ServiceLocator.cs: Actually start the browse request

2006-01-19  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* configure.ac: Added check for pkg-config to fix package detection
	bug; Added --enable-mdnsd to skip Avahi check and define ENABLE_MDNSD
	for compilation 

	* src/Makefile.am: Added files to DISTCLEANFILES so 'make distcheck' 
	works; build with -debug and link using arguments from 
	MCS_FLAGS (AVAHI_LIBS) instead of -pkg; compile Mono.Zeroconf 
	sources into assembly use daap_SCRIPTS instead of daap_DATA to 
	get a 0755 chmod; install daap-sharp.dll.{mdb,config}

	* src/Server.cs:
	* src/ServiceLocator.cs: Only compile Avahi-related code if ENABLE_MDNSD
	is not defined, otherwise, compile the alternate Mono.Zeroconf code; 
	these changes allow DAAP support to be compatible with Avahi and
	Apple's mDNSResponder Zerconf implementation; daap-sharp should now
	be easily portable to OS X and Windows

	* src/daap-sharp.dll.config.in: Added configuration file with DLL map
	for native mdns calls

	* sample/Makefile.am: Build tests with -debug 

	* sample/SampleServer.cs: Updated to reflect API changes in entagged

	* src/Mono.Zeroconf/*: Added sources for Mono.Zeroconf with a 
	sync-tree script to update sources from repository for bundling

	event if we already have it.

2006-01-09  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@aaronbock.net>

	* src/ContentWriter.cs:
	* src/ContentParser.cs: Use Mono.Unix.Native.NativeConvert instead of 
	UnixConvert

2006-01-08  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>
